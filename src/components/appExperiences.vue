IBM was my chance to really learn to code. In there I made friends that taught me unvaluable concepts, testing, design patterns, project management and agile culture. I was very lucky to work on IBM on that especific period of time, because IBM was transforming itself, applying agile culture and encouraging all teams to adopt. As a result, I had tons of courses, free and quality material for study, needless to say, also experience.',

        description: 'Boxnet was a mid-sized midia monitoring bussines. When I entered there, all of their systems were build with AngularJS(1.6), and... we had technologies like React, Vue, Angular (2+) that were blowing, so I suggested to update all systems to Vue. And I did it. It was a very hard time, but it was very rewarding. After sometime in there, they asked for a nodejs microservice, for a URL generation (and invalidation, to secure the data we sent to our clients). It was VERY hard, coming from a full front-end background, I learned a lot and even used technologies like docker, running clusters on Amazons ECS and storaging data with S3',

Hope to see what is the next thing I'll have to grasp to bring it into the app. Currently I'm using EC2 machines in Amazon, but I plan to move it to docker containers in the future :)",
